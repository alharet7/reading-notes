# Introduction to Identity on ASP.NET Core

Identity on ASP.NET Core is a topic that covers the basics of using Identity,it is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality and manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more. The source page that I read shows how to create a web app with authentication using Identity and how to test it. It also explains the components of Identity, such as the Identity Razor Class Library, the Identity database, the Identity UI pages, and the Identity services and middleware.


## What I got from the source page?

- Identity is a way to add authentication and authorization to ASP.NET Core web apps.
- Identity can use a SQL Server database or another persistent store to store user information.
- Identity can use external login providers such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.
- Identity is not related to the Microsoft identity platform, which is an alternative identity solution for ASP.NET Core apps.
- Identity can be scaffolded into a project and customized using the scaffolding tool in Visual Studio or the
- dotnet aspnet-codegenerator command-line tool.
- Identity can be configured using options such as PasswordOptions, LockoutOptions, UserOptions, SignInOptions, and CookieOptions.
- Identity can be tested using a browser or tools such as Postman or curl.

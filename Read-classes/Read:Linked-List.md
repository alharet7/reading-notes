### Big O 

- Big O notation is a way to represent the worst-case complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms. It defines the runtime of an algorithm by showing how its performance changes as the input size grows. Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.[READ MORE](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-cheat-sheet-time-complexity-chart/#:~:text=The%20Big%20O%20chart%2C%20also%20known%20as%20the,execution%20time%20or%20memory%20required%20by%20an%20algorithm.)

### Linked Lists 

- A Linked List is a sequence of `Nodes` that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each `Node` references the next `Node` in the link.

- One of the main advantages of using a linked list is that it is a dynamic data structure. This means that it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. So there is no need to give the initial size of the linked list.[READ MORE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-linked-list/)

- A few disadvantages to using a linked list. One disadvantage is that more memory is required in a linked list compared to an array because each node in a linked list requires a pointer to store the address of the next element. Another disadvantage is that traversal in a linked list can be more time-consuming compared to an array.[READ MORE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-linked-list/)

### Differences between linked lists and arrays

- both arrays and linked lists can be used to store collections of data. However, there are some key differences between the two data structures.

- One difference is that arrays are implemented with a dynamically resizing array, while linked lists are implemented with a doubly-linked list with two references maintained for the first and last node. This means that retrieval of an item is faster in an array, while insertion and deletion of items are faster in a linked list except for some special cases.[READ MORE](https://junaidhassanalvi.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/c-what-is-the-difference-between-arraylist-and-linkedlist/) &  [CHECK THIS](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-2-131d96f71996) .

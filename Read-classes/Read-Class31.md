# Razor Pages

Razor Pages is a web development framework that is part of ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform and open-source platform for building web applications. Razor Pages uses a page-based model, where each web page has a corresponding C# file that handles the logic and events of the page. Razor Pages also uses a templating syntax called Razor, which allows you to write HTML and C# code together in the same file. Razor Pages is designed to be easy to learn and use, especially for beginners who want to create dynamic web sites with minimal code. Razor Pages also supports advanced features such as dependency injection, authentication, authorization, and testing. 

Razor Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive than using controllers and views.

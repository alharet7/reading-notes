# Testing and Swagger and Deployment


## Swagger

Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code. Its main goals are to:

1- Minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services.

2- Reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.

There are two main OpenAPI implementations for .NET:
 Swashbuckle and NSwag. They provide the following components:

- A Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints.

- A Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models.

- An embedded version of the Swagger UI tool that interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality and testing the public methods.

To use Swashbuckle in your ASP.NET Core web API project, you need to:

- Install the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package.

- Add and configure the Swagger middleware in Program.cs.


## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a technique for verifying the behavior and quality of your code by writing automated tests that exercise its functionality. Unit testing can help you find and fix bugs, refactor your code with confidence, and improve your development process.

In ASP.NET MVC applications, you can write unit tests for your controllers, which are classes that handle requests and return responses. To write unit tests for controllers, you need to use a unit testing framework, such as MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit, and a mocking framework, such as Moq or NSubstitute, to isolate your controller from its dependencies.

## Testing Controllers

Controllers are parts of a program that tell what to do when you click a button or type something. Sometimes, controllers can have problems or mistakes that make them not work well. To find and fix these problems, you can use testing controllers.

Testing controllers are special programs that check if your controllers are working well. They can help you make sure that your controllers do what you want them to do and nothing else. Testing controllers can also help you make your program better and faster.

### 3 ways Unit Testing improves my codebase and productivity :
- Catching Bugs Early: By writing unit tests, I can identify bugs and errors in my code much earlier in the development cycle, before I propagate them to other parts of the application.

- Improving Code Quality: Unit testing can help me improve code quality by ensuring that each unit of code is functioning correctly and as expected. This helps to prevent errors and unexpected behavior in the application.

- Encouraging Good Programming Habits: Writing unit tests encourages good programming habits, such as writing code that is modular, easy to understand, and testable. This can help me to improve the overall quality of the codebase.

### How would I write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry?
- I have to write a unit test by breaking down the task into smaller units 
1. Check if the washing machine is working.
2. Check if the laundry is sorted by color and type of fabric.
3. Checking the program used in the washing machine according to the type of clothes.
4. Check if the clothes are dry or not.
5. Check that the clothes are sorted and puted in the correct place.

### 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code:
1. It is the first file a person will see when they encounter my project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
2. It will help me focus on what my project needs to deliver and how.
3. It will improve my writing skills.

### When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include:
1. Project's Title.
2. Project Description.
3. Table of Contents (Optional).
4. How to Install and Run the Project.
5. How to Use the Project.

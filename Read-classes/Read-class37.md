# JAMstack

JAMstack is a way of building websites and apps that are fast, secure, and easy to maintain. JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.

- **JavaScript** is the programming language that runs in our browser and makes our website interactive. For example, JavaScript can show or hide elements, validate forms, fetch data, and more.

- **APIs** are services that provide data and functionality to our website. For example, APIs can handle authentication, payments, comments, analytics, and more. We can use APIs from third-party providers or create our own.

- **Markup** is the code that defines the structure and style of our website. For example, HTML and CSS are markup languages that tell the browser how to display our content.

JAMstack websites are different from traditional websites because they do not rely on a server to generate the web pages dynamically. Instead, they use a process called pre-rendering to create static HTML files that are ready to be served to the browser. These files are stored in a content delivery network (CDN), which is a network of servers distributed around the world that can deliver our website faster and more reliably.

JAMstack websites have many benefits, such as:

- **Performance**: JAMstack websites load faster because they do not have to wait for the server to process the request and generate the page. They also benefit from the CDN’s caching and optimization features.

- **Security**: JAMstack websites are more secure because they do not expose a server that can be hacked or compromised. They also reduce the attack surface by using APIs that are designed for specific purposes and have their own security measures.

- **Scalability**: JAMstack websites can handle high traffic and sudden spikes without any issues because they do not depend on a single server that can get overloaded or crash. They also leverage the CDN’s ability to distribute the load across multiple servers and locations.

- **Maintainability**: JAMstack websites are easier to maintain because they have less code and complexity to deal with. They also allow developers to use modern tools and frameworks that suit their preferences and needs.

We can use JAMstack to build websites and apps with .NET technologies. For example, we can use:

- **Blazor**: A framework that lets we write interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.

- **Azure Static Web Apps**: A service that lets we deploy JAMstack websites with .NET functions as APIs.

- **Umbraco Heartcore**: A headless CMS that lets we manage our content with .NET APIs.

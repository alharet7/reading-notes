 # The Growth Mindset 

- To excel in web development, I need to prepare well for new courses. This builds a solid base for effective learning and skill development. Key principles for successful web development studies are deliberate practice, a growth mindset, grit, and redefining success. These principles guide the learning process, improve technical skills, and enhance the chances of success in the field.

- In the article "Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice," they talk about deliberate practice, which means focusing on specific areas to improve, breaking down complex skills into smaller parts, and practicing to get better. It's like planning and preparing before starting a home renovation. You research what skills you need, gather study materials, and make a plan for learning and practice.

- Carol Dweck's TEDxNorrkoping talk on "The power of believing that you can improve" is about having a growth mindset. Just like a homeowner needs to believe in their ability to learn during a renovation, having a growth mindset is important in programming and development. It means believing that skills can be developed through effort and learning from mistakes. It helps you stay motivated and overcome challenges.

- Angela Lee Duckworth's TED Talks Education video on "Grit: The power of passion and perseverance" talks about determination and perseverance. Like a homeowner needs determination to finish a renovation, having grit is important in studying programming. It means staying focused, motivated, and not giving up when faced with difficulties.

- Alain de Botton's TEDGlobal 2009 talk on "A kinder, gentler philosophy of success" encourages redefining success. When studying programming, it's important to think beyond immediate outcomes and comparing yourself to others. Success can be measured by personal growth, acquired skills, and finding joy in the learning process.

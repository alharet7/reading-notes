# Summary of relational databases and SQL.

*A relational database has many tables that keep data in a neat way. Each table has columns that say what the data is about and rows that have the data itself. SQL is a language that lets users with different skills use and change the data in these tables. SQL databases are popular because they are safe and can store a lot of data for websites and apps.*
